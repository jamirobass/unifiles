We are active in the field of cognitive neuroscience and cognitive neurology, with the following major areas: Development of a quantitative model of perceptual decision-making processes in the framework of stochastic diffusion models; neural correlates of individual differences in emotion processing during perceptual decisions on emotional stimuli; interaction of action-oriented and reward-processing brain regions during decision-making processes; influence of aging. Interdisciplinary Approach: Decision-making research is an interdisciplinary endeavor. In the past we have established collaborations with the Humboldt-University Law school and with the Gruter Institute for Law and Behavioral Research. We are also cooperating with the Department of Psychology. We are co-applicants of the to be established interdisciplinary Humboldt research center “conflict”. A strong cooperation exists with the MPI for human development.

Traditional research on decision-making, including neuroeconomics, is dominated by an unrealistic view of cognition that pictures the mind as a Bayesian optimizer. I study how real people make decisions when information and time are limited, and the future is uncertain. The key questions are (i) what heuristics and evolved capacities are in the adaptive toolbox of a species, (ii) in what tasks does which heuristic succeed, and (iii) how can we design efficient artificial decision algorithms (and environments) based on the results of this research.
